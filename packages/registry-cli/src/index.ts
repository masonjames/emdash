// citty's `runMain` only force-exits on error or `--help`; on normal
// completion it just resolves and lets the event loop drain. After a
// successful `login` the success message prints, `run()` returns, but
// something inside atcute / the loopback HTTP path leaves a ref'd handle
// alive indefinitely -- the CLI hangs forever instead of returning to the
// shell. (The same is true for `logout`'s revocation flow.) Force-exit on
// success so users get an immediate prompt back; non-success paths already
// `process.exit` themselves.
